## Character sets:
- **[]** group characters into a set; will match any **single** character from set
  - "/[bcd]art/" matches strings containing "bart", "cart" and "dart"
  - equivalent to "/(b|c|d)art/" but shorter

- Inside a set, specify a range of characters with hyphen **-**
  - "/[a-z]/" matches any lowercase letter
  - "/[a-zA-Z0-9]/" matches any lower or uppercase letter or digit
- An initial **^** inside a set negates it
  - "/[^abcd]/" matches any character other than a, b, c, d


## Escape sequences:
- Special escape sequence character sets
  - \d matches any digit (same as [0-9])
  - \D matches any non-digit (same as [^0-9])
  - \w matches any "word character" (same as [a-zA-Z_0-9]
  - \W matches any "non-word character"
  - \s matches any whitespace character ( , \t, \n, etc)
  - \S matches any non-whitespace
